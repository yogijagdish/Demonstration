### Introduction

This project introduces an Electronic Health Record Management System (EHRMS) that uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to improve the way patient records are managed in healthcare systems. Traditional paper-based methods can be inefficient, prone to errors, and difficult to access. The EHRMS combines RFID tags with patient identification to streamline record management, enhance data accuracy, and improve patient care. With RFID technology, patient identification is automated, and data is captured in real time, eliminating mistakes from manual entry and ensuring that EHRs are always up-to-date and easily accessible. By developing the EHRMS software, implementing RFID-enabled patient identification, and synchronizing with the EHR system, healthcare facilities can expect improved efficiency, reduced administrative burdens, and better data accuracy. Real-time access to patient records empowers healthcare providers to make informed decisions, leading to better diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Additionally, RFID integration optimizes the patient experience by reducing waiting times and increasing overall satisfaction. The successful implementation of the EHRMS has the potential to transform healthcare record management and contribute to improved patient outcomes. It offers a streamlined approach to managing electronic health records, eliminating the limitations of traditional paper-based systems. The findings and insights from this project can be a valuable resource for healthcare organizations seeking to enhance their record management processes and deliver more efficient and effective care.
